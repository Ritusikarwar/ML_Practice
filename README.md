# ML Practice Repository

This repository contains my hands-on practice notebooks and small projects while learning Machine Learning fundamentals using Python.  
The focus is on understanding core ML concepts through implementation and experimentation.

 Topics i have learned so far:-
 1) Types of Machine learning
 2) Machine Learning Development Cycle
 3) Tensors
 4) Feature Scaling:-
    a. Standardization
    b. Normalization
5) Encoding Categorical Data
6) Function Transformers:-
   a. Box-Cox Transformer
   b.Yeo Johnson Transformer
7) Converting numeric data to categorical Data
   a. Binning (Discretization)  > Types of Discretization
   # Equal Width Binning
   # Equal Frequency
   # K means binning
   b.Binarization
9) Handling Missing Data
